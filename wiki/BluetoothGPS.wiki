#summary J4ME Bluetooth GPS package.

= Introduction =

The J4ME Bluetooth GPS framework lets you get location information from a Bluetooth GPS puck through the JSR-179 Location API interface.

= Benefits =

 * Access location data from a Bluetooth GPS device
 * Makes JSR-179 implementations behave consistently

= Details =

The JSR-179 specification defines the Location API.  It is how a J2ME application can get the phone's current location.

The J4ME Bluetooth GPS package wraps and extends JSR-179.  The added functionality lets an application get location data from a separate GPS device through the phone's Bluetooth.  Many, many more phones support Bluetooth than do the Location API so for some phones it is the only option.  On other phones that use cell phone triangulation to get their location Bluetooth GPS offers a free and much more accurate alternative (less than 3 meters vs. 60).

Another advantage of J4ME Bluetooth GPS is that it brings consistency to JSR-179 implementations.  For example newer BlackBerry phones support JSR-179 access to their integrated GPS chips.  However the BlackBerry platform raises location events on the main UI thread which often leads to unresponsive applications that sometimes even crash.  The J4ME Bluetooth GPS implementation moves these events to a background thread without you doing any work.
